    name: "Abdominal aortic aneurysm",
    definition: "An abdominal aortic aneurysm is an abnormal widening of an artery caused by weakness in the blood vessel wall, most often occurring in the aorta. This condition increases the risk of rupture, potentially leading to a life-threatening hemorrhage. The exact causes are not fully understood, but a combination of genetic and environmental risk factors contribute to arterial wall weakness. These include smoking, high blood pressure, elevated cholesterol, advanced age (especially after 60), and male sex. Less common risk factors include trauma and connective tissue disorders such as collagenopathies. The disease is often asymptomatic and may remain undetected until rupture, though some individuals may experience abdominal pain, back pain, or a pulsating sensation near the navel. When rupture occurs, symptoms may include severe abdominal pain, dizziness, tachycardia, or hypotension, requiring urgent medical attention. Preventive strategies include early detection through imaging in high-risk groups (male smokers over 60 years of age with family history), and reducing modifiable risk factors such as smoking, hypertension, and high cholesterol.",

    name: "Abdominal hernia",
    definition: "An abdominal hernia is the protrusion of abdominal contents through a weakened point in the abdominal muscle wall, causing a noticeable bulge. Hernias are relatively common, do not resolve on their own, and often require surgical repair. Risk factors include male sex, chronic coughing, constipation, overweight or obesity, pregnancy, heavy lifting, abdominal surgery, premature birth, and a personal history of hernia. Symptoms vary depending on location (inguinal, femoral, umbilical, or epigastric) but typically include a hard, tense bulge that may worsen with exertion. Some individuals may experience discomfort, burning, heaviness, or pain. A serious complication is strangulation, where herniated contents lose blood supply, requiring emergency surgery. Prevention focuses on reducing abdominal pressure through maintaining a healthy weight, managing constipation with a fiber-rich diet, quitting smoking to prevent chronic coughing, and strengthening the abdominal wall with targeted exercises or physiotherapy, especially in high-risk individuals such as pregnant women or post-surgical patients.",

It results from frequent or prolonged exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, either from sunlight or artificial sources such as tanning beds. Risk factors include fair skin type, history of sunburns, chronic sun exposure, male sex, and immunosuppression (such as after organ transplantation). Comorbidities such as diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, or psoriasis may also influence its development. Lesions typically present as reddish-brown or yellowish-black papules or plaques with dry scales and may be asymptomatic or cause itching, burning, or tenderness. Actinic keratosis carries a risk of progression to squamous cell carcinoma in about 10% of cases, making early recognition and follow-up important. Prevention includes rigorous sun protection: regular use of broad-spectrum SPF 30+ sunscreen, protective clothing, avoidance of peak sun hours, and elimination of artificial UV exposure.",

It can occur at any age and may be life-threatening if untreated. The condition can be primary, most often autoimmune in origin (resulting in adrenal cortex destruction), or secondary, caused by insufficient stimulation from the pituitary gland due to tumors, surgery, or inflammation. In rare cases, infections like tuberculosis or adrenal hemorrhage can also lead to Addison's disease. Symptoms usually develop gradually and may include severe fatigue, weight loss, appetite loss, darkened skin pigmentation, low blood pressure, craving for salt, hypoglycemia, gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), muscle or abdominal pain, and hair loss. Sometimes the disease presents suddenly as an adrenal crisis, characterized by extreme weakness, confusion, severe abdominal or back pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and dangerously low blood pressure.

It affects 1.3–3% of the population. Clinically, AIS presents with trunk asymmetry, uneven shoulder height, scapular prominence, and asymmetric waist or iliac crest. The curvature is assessed via orthopedic exam, the Adams forward bend test, scoliometer, radiographs, or advanced imaging. Most adolescents are asymptomatic, though some experience back pain, and severe cases may lead to rib deformities or respiratory impairment.

Most cases are primary (essential) hypertension, reflecting dysregulation of vascular tone, renal sodium handling, and neurohormonal systems (RAAS, sympathetic activity). A minority are secondary to identifiable causes such as chronic kidney disease, primary aldosteronism, renal artery stenosis, thyroid/parathyroid disease, or medications.

The clot obstructs venous return, potentially leading to swelling, pain, and local inflammation. The most severe complication arises when part of the thrombus dislodges, traveling through the bloodstream and reaching the pulmonary arteries, causing pulmonary embolism (PE), a potentially life-threatening condition. DVT often develops silently and may be asymptomatic until complications appear. Several acquired and hereditary risk factors contribute to its onset, including immobility (bed rest, long flights), recent surgery (especially orthopedic), fractures, pregnancy, obesity, use of oral estrogens, smoking, malignancy, autoimmune disease, polycythemia vera, and the presence of central venous catheters. Genetic predisposition also plays a role, particularly with thrombophilic mutations (e.g., Factor V Leiden, Prothrombin G20210A). Symptoms, when present, may include swelling (edema), pain that worsens with standing or walking, warmth and redness of the affected limb, and skin color changes. In some cases, the first manifestation is pulmonary embolism, presenting with chest pain, shortness of breath, or hemoptysis. Preventive measures focus on reducing risk in high-risk populations, including early mobilization after surgery or illness, use of compression stockings, prophylactic anticoagulation, and lifestyle modifications (healthy weight, exercise, smoking cessation).",
