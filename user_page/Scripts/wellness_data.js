        definition: "The body's antioxidant defense system, especially the enzymes glutathione peroxidase and catalase, are responsible for keeping the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) low to avoid a physiological state of oxidative stress. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are by-products of normal cellular activity. They are produced in many cellular compartments and play an important role in signaling pathways. However, overproduction of ROS disrupts the body's antioxidant defense system and can lead to oxidative stress. This situation is associated with the development of several human diseases (such as cancer, cardiovascular, neurodegenerative and metabolic disorders), inflammation and aging. Antioxidant mechanisms protect cells against ROS-induced oxidative damage. The body's antioxidant defense system has been reported to consist of SOD (manganese superoxide dismutase), CAT (catalase), GST (glutathione S-transferase) and GSH (glutathione) activity. SOD catalyzes the breakdown of endogenous cytotoxic superoxide radicals into H2O2, which is degraded by CAT. Therefore, they play a crucial role in the maintenance of physiological O2 and H2O2 levels. On the other hand, GSH, together with GST, has a basic role in cellular defense against deleterious free radicals and other oxidative species. GST catalyzes the conjugation of the thiol group of glutathione to electrophilic substrates and thus detoxifies endogenous compounds such as peroxidized lipids. Its activity and ability to protect cells and tissues from ROS and their harmful products are influenced by polymorphisms in antioxidant genes.",

Apolipoprotein A1 is a relatively large protein, encoded by the APOA1 gene, which is the major component of HDL particles. ApoA1 is essential for the maintenance of lipid balance in the body and protection against atherosclerosis. Blood levels of apolipoprotein A1 are an important indicator of cardiovascular health along with apolipoprotein B or ApoB which is the most abundant protein in atherogenic particles such as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles usually called 'bad cholesterol'. The calculation of the ApoB/ApoA1 ratio can be helpful in estimating the risk of atherosclerosis and heart disease, among other parameters. There are multiple studies suggesting that low levels of apolipoprotein A1 are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, including heart disease and some forms of hereditary dyslipidemias, considered rare diseases, such as hereditary visceral amyloidosis and hypoalphalipoproteinemia-2. Plasma ApoA1 levels can be influenced by a variety of both genetic and other factors (dietary, lifestyle, medical conditions and treatments, hormonal factors, etc.).",

ApoB is the most abundant protein in atherogenic particles. The Apo-B100 isoform is part of the low-density particles that include very low density (VLDL), intermediate density (IDL), low density (LDL) and lipoprotein a or Lp(a) particles, while the Apo-B48 isoform is present in the larger particles known as chylomicrons. The number of ApoB particles that enter and become trapped in the arterial wall is determined primarily by the number of ApoB particles found in the arterial lumen. ApoB-containing particles that are smaller and poorer in cholesterol (such as LDL particles) have a greater tendency to become trapped than larger VLDL-type ApoB particles. Once retained in the artery wall, all ApoB particles are equally atherogenic. As the cholesterol content varies between different ApoB particles, triglyceride and cholesterol levels are not always accurate measures for estimating the number of ApoB particles. ApoB levels may be a more accurate indicator of atherogenic risk or likelihood of lipid accumulation in the artery wall.

The main structure housing sensory endings are the papillae of the tongue, which can distinguish sweet, bitter, sour, salty and umami. Sour and salty substances are linked to ion channels, while sweet, bitter and umami tastes are transmitted through G-protein-linked receptors encoded by the TAS2R gene family. Bitterness has the characteristic taste of gall, quinine and other alkaloids, producing an unpleasant and long-lasting sensation. The perception of bitterness is a defense mechanism against potentially toxic substances. Although no direct relationship between bitterness and food toxicity has been established, many common bittering agents, such as strychnine and nicotine, are toxic. The sensation of bitterness arises when certain chemicals contact specialized receptors on the tongue. This perception varies among individuals due to genetic differences, influencing food preferences and consumption.",

HDL cholesterol (high density lipoprotein) is a lipoprotein of the chylomicron group whose functions are to transport lipids such as phospholipids, triglycerides or cholesterol. It differs from other lipoproteins such as LDL by its higher density, due to having a greater amount of proteins in its composition. The main function of HDL is the transport of cholesterol from peripheral tissues to the liver, playing a role in lipid biodistribution. It is commonly known as 'good cholesterol' due to its anti-atherogenic and anti-inflammatory properties, thanks to its uptake and return to the liver of cholesterol stored in the foam cells of atherosclerotic plaques. It thus reduces plaque size and its associated inflammation, reducing the risk of atherosclerosis, a precursor of myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attack and stroke. It is well established that elevated HDL levels (>40 mg/dL) are associated with a lower risk of coronary heart disease and are thought to play a role in predicting cardiovascular risk. HDL cholesterol levels can vary for different reasons. Genetic factor is among the factors influencing the levels of this lipoprotein. Compared to genetically determined abnormalities of HDL metabolism, low HDL-C levels occur much more frequently in patients with metabolic syndrome or diabetes mellitus. Low HDL-C levels are also associated with systemic inflammation, e.g., smoking, chronic inflammatory diseases or chronic kidney disease. In cases of extremely low HDL-C, a rare diagnosis, e.g., neoplasia or an increased risk of sepsis, may be considered. Some established HDL cholesterol levels based on their relationship to cardiovascular disease risk are mentioned below: Less than 40 mg/dL in men = low HDL (increased risk). Less than 50 mg/dL in women = low HDL (higher risk). 40 to 59 mg/dL = Higher is better. 60 mg/dL and above = high HDL (lower risk).",

        name: "Muscle endurance",
        definition: "Muscle endurance is the ability of muscles to sustain repeated contractions against resistance. Genetics influences fiber type distribution—type I (slow-twitch) for endurance, type II (fast-twitch) for power. Sprinters and power athletes tend to have more fast fibers, while endurance athletes have more slow fibers. Strength, muscle size, training, and diet also affect endurance. Glycogen storage capacity plays a role in sustaining muscle activity.",

        definition: "Myoadenylate deaminase deficiency (MAD) is a metabolic myopathy caused by AMPD1 gene variants, most often c.34C>T. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner with incomplete penetrance. MAD affects purine nucleotide metabolism by impairing conversion of AMP to IMP and ammonia in skeletal muscles. Symptoms include post-exercise muscle pain and reduced exercise tolerance, though many people remain asymptomatic. Some evidence links MAD to reduced athletic performance or cardioprotective effects in heart failure.",

        name: "Prediction of visceral adipose tissue",
        definition: "Visceral adipose tissue is the fat stored around internal organs. Its increase has been linked as a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, such as heart attack and atherosclerosis, and metabolic diseases. Adipose tissue or fat tissue is made up of cells capable of accumulating fat, the adipocytes. This tissue has various functions such as metabolic, cushioning, protecting and holding in place internal organs and other structures of the body. In the human body, adipose tissue is located under the skin (subcutaneous fat), around the organs (visceral fat), in the bone marrow (yellow bone marrow) and in the breasts. Specifically, visceral fat functions as a lipid reserve and provides protection. In general, men tend to have a higher rate of visceral fat due to male hormones, while women accumulate subcutaneous fat in the buttocks, hips and limbs due to oestrogen. After menopause, women start to accumulate more fat in the abdomen. Visceral fat is located in the abdominal cavity and its excess has been directly related to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, inflammatory diseases and other obesity-related diseases. Why abdominal fat is more harmful than other fat deposits, such as subcutaneous adipose tissue, has not been fully elucidated. Possible hypotheses point to a greater lipolytic capacity and its resistance to the antilipolytic effects of insulin, resulting in higher concentrations of circulating fatty acids. In addition, studies also point to visceral fat having a higher rate of macrophage infiltration, resulting in a proinflammatory profile that promotes insulin resistance.",

        name: "Preference for sweets",
        definition: "Sweet is one of the five basic tastes, universally considered pleasurable. It is detected mainly in taste buds at the tip of the tongue. Sweet molecules in nature include sugars found mainly in plants (fructose, sucrose, glucose) and lactose in milk, all providing energy and sweetness. This preference may have evolved to help identify energy-rich foods. Factors influencing sweet preference are complex, including age, diet, hormones, body weight, genetics, weight loss, sensory input, personality, ethnicity, lifestyle, exposure history, and disease. Artificial sweeteners mimic natural sweet taste but without the caloric content. Understanding why some people have a greater preference for sweets can help in managing conditions like diabetes and obesity.",
